      <p>I made this website to show people more about how to help save the coral reefs, and the environment as a whole. Many people think that they need to do something big or expensive, like buying an electric car, to make a change, but that simply isn't true. This was the motivation behind starting the monthly chalenges.</p>
      <p> The environment can be saved if almost everyone decides to be more environmentally friendly. The catch is that many people believe that we will never reach this point, and think there is no point in trying. Consequently, they live unsustainable lives. Or, they think that someone else can do it, and they don't need to do anything. Both of these notions are simply untrue. </p>
