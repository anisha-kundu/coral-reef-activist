        <div id="cleanup-text" class="action">
          <p>Water pollution is a huge issue in general, and also directly contributes to reef degradation. There are many organizations that host ocean cleanups, such as <a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/">The Ocean Cleanup.</a> If you live near the coast, most beaches have cleanup programs, and if not, it doesn't hurt to start one yourself! If you don't, be sure to keep your local watershed healthy, as all of it will eventually end up in the ocean.</p>

        <h2 class="head">Use less water!</h2>
        <div id="water-text" class="action">
          <p>Using less water means that less water will finds its way back to the ocean as wastewater, and you get a lower water bill too. It also helps to save water during water shortages or droughts, as many people may not have access to water. Though water may seem abundant, less than one percent of it is available for human consumption. Plus, when you waste water, you are also wasting the energy required to make it drinkable.</p>

        <h2 class="head">Play your part in reducing global warming!</h2>
        <div id="warming-text" class="action">
          <p>Global warming is another huge contributing factor to coral destruction. Higher water temperatures causes coral bleaching, which is when the coral releases an algae that is stored in their tissues, turning them into a ghostly white color. It is left very vulnerable, as the algae is its main source of food. This is why it is important to try and reduce carbon emmisions when possible, like taking the bus instead of driving, or using an electric car.</p>
